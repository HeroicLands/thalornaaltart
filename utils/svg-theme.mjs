/**
 * Make a bundled black-on-transparent icon SVG adapt to light/dark mode.
 *
 * This module's icons (`assets/icons/**`) are solid black silhouettes, which
 * vanish on a dark surface — and critically in the Foundry compendium and
 * directory windows, whose `<img>` thumbnails no scoped CSS can reach. The only
 * styling that travels with an `<img>`-loaded SVG is the SVG itself, so we
 * inject a `<style>` block carrying a `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` fill
 * swap: iron-gall ink in light, cream in dark.
 *
 * This is a deliberate copy of the SoHL system's `utils/svg-theme.mjs`, because
 * `package-build` takes `assetTransform` as a *repository-local* module rather
 * than shipping one. The behaviour must match the system's exactly: a module's
 * icons sit beside the system's in the same compendium listing, and an icon that
 * themed differently would be visibly wrong. If the rule ever moves into the
 * shared toolchain, both copies should go with it.
 *
 * Applied at build time only (see {@link transform}, which
 * `package-build assets` calls for every staged file) — the source SVGs stay
 * pristine black-on-transparent so the knowledgebase and website (which render
 * them on light ground) are unaffected.
 *
 * A CSS rule overrides a `fill` presentation attribute, so this recolors shapes
 * that are explicitly black (`fill="#000"` / `black`) or default-black (no `fill`
 * attribute), while leaving intentionally light-colored shapes alone. It does
 * **not** touch a file whose shapes carry an inline `style="fill:…"` (inline
 * style wins over a `<style>` rule) — those are returned unchanged rather than
 * half-recolored.
